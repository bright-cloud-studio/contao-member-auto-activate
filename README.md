# Bright Cloud Studio's Contao Member Auto-Activate
Allows new Member accounts to be activated automatically during registration.

## Usage
Once installed, when creating a "Registration" module you will see two new options. "Auto Activate" is a checkbox that when checked will cause Members to auto activate when being created. Auto Activation can be limited to emails for certain domains by entering those domains into the "Auto activate domains" field, listing one domain per line.
